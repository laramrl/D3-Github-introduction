  <h1 class="Titre2">THE DOG AND CAT</h1>
<p>A dog and cat, messmates for life,</br>
  Were often falling into strife,</br>
  Which came to scratching, growls, and snaps,</br>
  And spitting in the face, perhaps.</br>
  A neighbour dog once chanced to call</br>
  Just at the outset of their brawl,</br>
  And, thinking Tray was cross and cruel,</br>
  To snarl so sharp at Mrs. Mew-well,</br>
  Growl'd rather roughly in his ear.</br>
  'And who are you to interfere?'</br>
  Exclaim'd the cat, while in his face she flew;</br>
  And, as was wise, he suddenly withdrew.</br>
  It seems, in spite of all his snarling,</br>
  And hers, that Tray was still her darling.</p>

  <h2>THE LION AND RAT</h2>
  <p>“ Be kind whene'er you can,” should be your creed,</br>
There's none so small but you his aid may need.</br>
This striking truth two fables now shall prove ;</br>
Matter enough is here your faith to move.</br>
A blundering rat burst through the earth,</br>
And fell into the lion's paws.</br>
The animal of royal birth
Scorned with such blood to stain his claws :</br>
He spared his life, the kindness was repaid ;</br>
Who'd think the lion could e'er require his aid ?</br>
However, 'twas the lion's lot,</br>
Leaving the forest, in a net to fall,</br>
Nor could his rage and roaring break the thrall.</br>
  The rat ran to his aid, and speedily Gnawed through a mesh and set him free.</br>
Patience and length of time will still
Much more than force and rage fulfil.</p>

<h3>THE IRON POT AND CLAY POT</h3>
<p>An iron pot proposed one day
       To travel with a pot of clay :</br>
      The latter made his best excuse,</br>
       And thought it prudent to refuse :</br>
       “ Better,” he said, “ to stay at home,</br>
       Than idly thus abroad to roam.</br>
       For me the smallest thing that hits,</br>
       Will crack or break me all to bits,</br>
       Nor scrap of me find home again.</br>
       But you,” he cried, “ let nought detain ;</br>
       Your texture shows such strength of skin,</br>
       I see not aught to keep you in.”</br>
       “ I’ll screen you,” cried the solid pot ;</br>
       “ If aught of danger be your lot ;</br>
       I’ll get between the two, ye know,</br>
       And from your body ward the blow."</br>
       This offer made his fears subside,</br>
       He joined the iron pot with pride,</br>
       And both went hobbling on together,</br>
       Laughing at accidents and weather.</br>
But shortly they too near each other roll,</br>
As they went jogging cheek by jowl ;</br>
And all along the way
Suffered that pot of clay.</br>
Hardly, in fine, a hundred paves gone,</br>
When by his comrade he was overthrown,</br>
And smashed to bits without the time to groan.</br>
Then let us with our equals only stay,</br>
Or think with trembling on that pot of clay.</p>
