  <h1>THE DOG AND CAT</h1>
<p>A dog and cat, messmates for life,</p>
  <p>Were often falling into strife,</p>
  <p>Which came to scratching, growls, and snaps,</p>
  <p>And spitting in the face, perhaps.</p>
  <p>A neighbour dog once chanced to call</p>
  <p>And, thinking Tray was cross and cruel,</p>
  <p>To snarl so sharp at Mrs. Mew-well,</p>
  <p>Growl'd rather roughly in his ear.</p>
  <p>'And who are you to interfere?'</p>
  <p>Exclaim'd the cat, while in his face she flew;</p>
  <p>And, as was wise, he suddenly withdrew.</p>
  <p>It seems, in spite of all his snarling,</p>
  <p>And hers, that Tray was still her darling.</p>

  <h2>THE LION AND RAT</h2>
  <p>“ Be kind whene'er you can,” should be your creed,</p>
<p>There's none so small but you his aid may need.</p>
<p>This striking truth two fables now shall prove ;</p>
<p>Matter enough is here your faith to move.</p>
<p>A blundering rat burst through the earth,</p>
<p>And fell into the lion's paws.</p>
<p>The animal of royal birth
Scorned with such blood to stain his claws :</p>
<p>He spared his life, the kindness was repaid ;</p>
<p>Who'd think the lion could e'er require his aid ?</p>
<p>However, 'twas the lion's lot,</p>
<p>Leaving the forest, in a net to fall,</p>
<p>Nor could his rage and roaring break the thrall.</p>
  <p>The rat ran to his aid, and speedily Gnawed through a mesh and set him free.</p>
<p>Patience and length of time will still
Much more than force and rage fulfil.</p>

<h3>THE IRON POT AND CLAY POT</h3>
<p>An iron pot proposed one day
       To travel with a pot of clay :</p>
       <p>The latter made his best excuse,</p>
       <p>And thought it prudent to refuse :</p>
       <p>“ Better,” he said, “ to stay at home,</p>
       <p>Than idly thus abroad to roam.</p>
       <p>For me the smallest thing that hits,</p>
       <p>Will crack or break me all to bits,</p>
       <p>Nor scrap of me find home again.</p>
       <p>But you,” he cried, “ let nought detain ;</p>
       <p>Your texture shows such strength of skin,</p>
       <p>I see not aught to keep you in.”</p>
       <p>“ I’ll screen you,” cried the solid pot ;</p>
       <p>“ If aught of danger be your lot ;</p>
       <p>I’ll get between the two, ye know,</p>
       <p>And from your body ward the blow."</p>
       <p>This offer made his fears subside,</p>
       <p>He joined the iron pot with pride,</p>
       <p>And both went hobbling on together,</p>
       <p>Laughing at accidents and weather.</p>
<p>But shortly they too near each other roll,</p>
<p>As they went jogging cheek by jowl ;</p>
<p>And all along the way
Suffered that pot of clay.</p>
<p>Hardly, in fine, a hundred paves gone,</p>
<p>When by his comrade he was overthrown,</p>
<p>And smashed to bits without the time to groan.</p>
<p>Then let us with our equals only stay,</p>
<p>Or think with trembling on that pot of clay.</p>
